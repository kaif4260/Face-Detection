# Face-Detection
This project implements a basic face liveness detection system in Python to determine whether a detected face is a live human or a spoof (e.g. printed photo, screen replay, etc.). It uses a mix of classical computer-vision and texture-analysis techniques rather than heavy deep-learning models.
